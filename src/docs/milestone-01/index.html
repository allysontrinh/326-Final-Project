            <!-- Related content or subsections -->
                As busy college students, the assignments and responsibilities we carry on our shoulders can be a struggle to chip away at. Many find that utilizing organizational tools can make their mountain of to-do’s seem more manageable. Whether those tools are planners, calendars, electronic reminders, or “keeping it all in your head”, everybody has a method that works best for them. But oftentimes, even planning and organizing the tasks themselves can be and overwhelming. This web application aims to tackle the problem of disorganization and the mental toll it takes on an average college student. By providing multiple tools like custom planners, calendars, and browser-enabled notifications, any user should be able to utilize them to organize their assignments, plans, or to-do tasks. At the same time, the more fun aspects of this web-app like character creation, a mood tracker, and mindfulness space provides a virtual safe space where the user can decompress and enjoy some activities that can take their minds off the hardships of a long day.
