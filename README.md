# Welcome Home!

#### This is a final project designed and built for CS326 (Web Programming). The goal was to create an interactive and aesthetically-pleasing web app that allows users to enter a 'virtual safe space' where they can journal, set reminders, feed their virtual cat (how cute!?), play music, and customize their character.

## Tech-stack
#### Javascript/HTML/CSS
#### Express
#### PouchDB
#### Node

## Command to run: 
#### npm start
#### To properly run everything with the Auth, go to this doc for instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osIG_1NZ1YiO34Q53JWky-RB4PNbcdfKZTFJn54ydII/edit?usp=sharing 

## Overview
#### Our front-end for Welcome Home currently utilizes four different main "screens": a log-in screen, home (or "room") screen, closet screen, and a desk/notebook screen. With custom hand-drawn backgrounds and assets, Welcome Home ensures that users are able to appreciate and use every little detail within the app, feeling right at home. 

## Log-In
#### For authentication, we chose to use Google OAuth to make things simple: The user signs in with their GMail of choice to bring them right to the main room. 

## Room
#### From the room, you can access the closet, mediation corner, your cat, a calendar, and the Notebook. Click on each to check them out! Your cat loves napping and getting pats on the head: try clicking on him to give him a treat! :)

## Closet
#### In the closet, you can customize your character with multiple different options for your eyes, mouth, nose, eyebrows, hair, clothes, and accessories! Feel free to spend as much time as you want dressing up your character; the possibilites are endless! What look will you go for today?

## Notebook 
#### Opening up the Notebook allows you to jot down anything and everything on your mind. You can save whatever you write down, just make sure to title your entry! Need to refer back to page you wrote earlier? No problem! You can access all of your saved entries through the drop-down menu. Made a mistake and want to delete one page, or ALL pages? Easy! Use this space to structure your To-Do list, take notes, or journal whatever you feel like.
